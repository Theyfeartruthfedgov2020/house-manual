      <heading>LEGISLATIVE PROCEDURES ENACTED IN LAW</heading>
      <preliminary>
        <text id="s1130">Congress has, from time to time, passed laws reserving to itself an absolute or limited right of review by approval or disapproval of certain actions of the executive branch or of independent agencies. These laws usually envision some form of congressional action falling into one of three general categories: (1) action by both Houses of Congress on a bill or joint resolution requiring presidential signature; (2) action by one or both Houses of Congress on a simple or concurrent resolution; and (3) action by a congressional committee. Although provisions in the first category remain viable, provisions in the latter two categories should be read in light of Immigration and Naturalization Service <i>v.</i> Chadha, 462 U.S. 919 (1983). In that case the Supreme Court held unconstitutional as in violation of the presentment clause of article I, section 7, and the doctrine of separation of powers the provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act contemplating disapproval of a decision of the Attorney General to allow an otherwise deportable alien to remain in the United States by simple resolution of one House. That same year, the Supreme Court summarily affirmed several lower court decisions invalidating provisions contemplating disapproval of executive actions by methods described in both categories (2) and (3) above. 463 U.S. 1216 (1983). Since then, Congress has amended several “legislative procedure” statutes to convert provisions requiring simple or concurrent resolutions to provisions requiring joint resolutions.</text>
        <text>Many “legislative procedure” statutes prescribe special procedures for the House to follow when reviewing executive actions. These procedures, termed “privileged procedures,” technically are Rules of the House, enacted expressly or impliedly as an exercise of the House’s rulemaking authority. At the beginning of each Congress, it is customary for the House to re-incorporate by reference in the resolution adopting its rules such “legislative procedure” procedures as may exist in current law. Nevertheless, because the House retains the constitutional right to change its rules at any time, the Committee on Rules may report a resolution varying the statutorily prescribed procedures for the House.</text>
        <text>Below is a compilation of the various provisions in “legislative procedure” statutes setting forth “privileged procedures” to be followed by the House when considering executive actions, together with any annotations of decisions of the Chair interpreting those provisions. Although some annotations provide pertinent legislative history, this compilation does not endeavor to provide a comprehensive record of legislative history for every provision. Excerpts of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act, formerly carried after the Congressional Budget Act, have been scaled down and moved to this segment of the Manual for quick reference to the legislative procedures therein. The primary enforcement mechanisms in the statute (such as sequestration) are no longer carried because they are not legislative procedures. However, sections 250, 251, 251A, and 252 operate in conjunction with procedural provisions in title III of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, <i>supra</i>. Sections 258, 258A, 258B, and 258C primarily provide for reporting and consideration of legislation in the Senate; therefore, only portions of those sections are carried here. A more thorough understanding of the statutory scheme requires the full statutory text (see 2 U.S.C. 900).</text>

        <note>
          <p>In the 94th Congress the President was granted authority to implement a “Sinai early-warning system” involving the assignment of civilian personnel to noncombat functions. In the same enactment, Congress provided for privileged consideration of a concurrent resolution calling for the removal of such personnel (see 22 U.S.C. 2348 note).</p>
          <p>In the 98th Congress the Committee on Foreign Affairs reported a joint resolution providing statutory authorization under the War Powers Resolution for a multinational peacekeeping force in Lebanon. The joint resolution would have been subject to consideration under the procedural provisions of the statute, but the House adopted a special order reported from the Committee on Rules varying the procedures for consideration of the joint resolution and also providing for consideration of a similar Senate joint resolution (H. Res. 318, Sept. 28, 1983, p. 26108). The House subsequently passed a Senate joint resolution on the subject that changed the Rules of the House and Senate to provide special procedures for consideration of a joint resolution or bill to amend or repeal its provisions (P.L. 98–119, Sept. 29, 1983, p. 26493).</p>
          <p>The 98th Congress provided for expedited consideration in the Senate of bills or joint resolutions requiring the removal of U.S. forces engaged in hostilities outside U.S. territory without a declaration of war (P.L. 98–164, 97 Stat. 1062). Those procedures appear in section 601(b) of the International Security Assistance and Arms Export Control Act of 1976 (P.L. 94–329; 90 Stat. 765).</p>
          <p>In the 102d and 107th Congresses the President was granted specific authority within the meaning of section 5(b) of the Act to use U.S. armed forces (P.L. 102–1; P.L. 107–40; P.L. 107–243).</p>
          <p>In the 103d Congress the Committee on Foreign Affairs reported H. Con. Res. 170, directing the President pursuant to 5(c) of the Act to remove United States Armed Forces from Somalia by January 31, 1994. By unanimous consent the House extended by one day the time for privileged consideration of that measure under section 7(b) (Nov. 4, 1993, p. 27393).</p>
          <p>In the 105th Congress the Committee on International Relations (now Foreign Affairs) reported H. Con. Res. 227, directing the President pursuant to section 5(c) of the Act to remove United States Armed Forces from the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. By unanimous consent the House postponed consideration of the measure until a date certain and provided for its consideration under a “closed” procedure (Mar. 12, 1998, p. 3398).</p>
          <p>In the 106th Congress the Committee on International Relations (now Foreign Affairs) reported H. Con. Res. 82, directing the President pursuant to section 5(c) of the Act to remove United States Armed Forces from their positions in connection with the operations against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, and H. J. Res. 44, pursuant to section 5(b) of the Act and article I, section 8 of the Constitution, declaring a state of war between the United States and the Government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. The House adopted a special order reported from the Committee on Rules varying the statutory procedures for consideration of both measures (H. Res. 151, Apr. 28, 1999, p. 7718).</p>

        <note>
          <p>It is not in order to offer as privileged a motion to discharge the Committee on the District of Columbia (now Oversight and Government Reform) from a simple (now joint) resolution disapproving an act passed by the D.C. City Council before the time that the Council was vested with the authority to pass the category of act to which the simple resolution disapproval procedure applies (Speaker Albert, Sept. 22, 1976, pp. 31873–74). The D.C. City Council subsequently having been vested with that authority, a motion to discharge the Committee on the District of Columbia (now Oversight and Government Reform) from further consideration of a (joint) resolution disapproving an act of the Council amending the D.C. Criminal Code is privileged after 20 calendar days from introduction of the resolution, if not reported during that time (Oct. 1, 1981, p. 22752; Oct. 14, 1987, p. 27847).</p>
          <p>Section 604 does not provide a privileged motion to discharge the Committee on the District of Columbia (now Oversight and Government Reform) from a concurrent (now joint) resolution disapproving acts of the D.C. City Council not affecting the D.C. Criminal Code, such concurrent resolutions only being privileged when reported by that committee (Speaker Albert, Sept. 22, 1976, pp. 31873–74). The House has provided that section 604(g) not apply to a specified joint resolution of disapproval (not affecting the D.C. Criminal Code) and instead provided for its separate consideration by special order of business (Apr. 30, 2015, p. __). Under section 604(h), debate on a concurrent (now joint) resolution of disapproval can be limited by motion, but otherwise extends not to exceed 10 hours; a concurrent (now joint) resolution disapproving an action of the D.C. Council that does not affect the U.S. Treasury is considered in the House (Dec. 20, 1979, p. 37303).</p>

            <p>In Clinton <i>v.</i> City of New York, 524 U.S. 417 (1998), the Supreme Court held that the cancellation procedures of the Line Item Veto Act violated the presentment clause of article I, section 7 of the Constitution. During the period between the January 1, 1997, effective date of the Act and the Court decision, the President exercised his authority under the Act to cancel dollar amounts of discretionary budget authority (see <i>e.g.,</i> H. Doc. 105–147), new direct spending (H. Doc. 105–115), and limited tax benefits (H. Doc. 105–116). Cancellations were effective unless disapproved by law (P.L. 105–159). The congressional review procedures remained in the law until their expiration on January 1, 2005, but were not invoked following the Court’s decision. Accordingly their text is omitted here but may be found in pp. 1029–45 of the House Rules and Manual for the 105th Congress. The procedures may be summarized as follows: The cancellations were transmitted to the Congress by the President by a special message within five calendar days after the enactment of the law to which the cancellation applied. The Act provided for a congressional review period of 30 calendar days of session with expedited House consideration of bills disapproving the cancellations including: (1) prescribing the text (section 1026(6)); (2) referral to committee with directions to report within seven calendar days subject to a motion to discharge (section 1025(d)); (3) consideration of a disapproval bill in the Committee of the Whole with no amendment in order (except that a Member, supported by 49 other Members, could offer an amendment striking cancellations from the bill), and consideration of the bill for amendment limited to one hour (section 1025(d)); and (4) one-calendar-day availability for a conference report (section 1025(f)). The Act also provided for expedited procedures in the Senate.</p>

            <p>Pursuant to section 151(f)(2) of this Act debate on an implementing revenue bill must be equally divided and controlled among those favoring and opposing the bill (absent an order of the House establishing some other distribution of the time); a motion to limit debate on such legislation must be made in the House, and not in the Committee of the Whole, and may be made either pending the motion to resolve into Committee of the Whole or at a later time, after the Committee has risen without completing action on the bill (July 10, 1979, pp. 17812, 17813). An implementing bill reported from committee has been considered as privileged under the Act (Nov. 14, 1980, p. 29617). The House has adopted a special order recommended by the Committee on Rules providing for consideration of both a resolution to deny the extension of “fast-track” procedures requested by the President under section 1103(b) of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 and a resolution to express the sense of the House concerning U.S. negotiating objectives after such an extension (May 23, 1991, p. 12137). For other special orders altering procedures under the Trade Act of 1974, see, <i>e.g.</i>, July 27, 2005, p. 17978; Apr. 10, 2008, p. 5640. The Senate has affirmed its constitutional authority to enact a statutory rule (as in subsection (d) of section 151) prohibiting amendments to specified revenue bills in derogation of its constitutional authority to propose amendments to House revenue bills (presiding officer sustained on appeal) (Nov. 19, 1993, p. 30641).</p>

        <note>
          <p>In 1985, the Salary Act was amended to require a salary commission report with respect to fiscal year 1987. The President transmitted recommendations concerning that report in the fiscal year 1988 Budget message (Jan. 5, 1987, H. Doc. 100–11). Because not disapproved by the Congress in accordance with the Salary Act (2 U.S.C. 359), those recommendations took effect on March 1, 1987. On return to the normal quadrennial cycle, the President transmitted with the fiscal year 1990 Budget message recommendations concerning a salary commission report with respect to fiscal year 1989 (Jan. 9, 1989, H. Doc. 101–21). Those recommendations were disapproved by Public Law 101–1 (H. J. Res. 129, 101st Cong., Feb. 7, 1989, p. 1708). In 1989, the Salary Act was amended to redesignate the Commission, refine the parameters for quadrennial adjustments, and provide for privileged consideration of legislation to approve adjustments recommended by the President. The quadrennial review contemplated by the statute has not occurred since 1993. Adjustments are to maintain equal levels of pay among the Speaker, the Vice President, and the Chief Justice; among the Majority and Minority Leaders, the President pro tempore of the Senate, and level I of the Executive Schedule; and among Representatives, Senators, certain judges, and level II of the Executive Schedule (2 U.S.C. 362).</p>
          <p style="margin-top:3pt">Under section 311(d) of the Legislative Branch Appropriations Act, 1988 (2 U.S.C. 4532), the Speaker may adjust pay levels for officers and employees of the House to maintain certain relationships with comparable levels in the Senate and in the other branches of government. This authority to issue “pay orders” is stated as follows:</p>

Managers in the Committee of the Whole yielded control of portions of their time by unanimous consent (Oct. 27, 2005, p. 23979).  The manager calling up a joint resolution pursuant to this section is entitled to close debate thereon (even when opposed, as in the case of a joint resolution reported adversely) (Oct. 27, 2005, p. 23993).  The House by special rule restricted the availability of the motion to proceed to consider a joint resolution pursuant to this section (Sept. 29, 2005, p. 21786). Because the Commission has not submitted a report pursuant to the statute since 2005, these procedures have been truncated in this compilation.</p>

        <note>
          <p>The following excerpts of chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code, do not contain privileged procedures for the consideration of a measure in the House. They are depicted here because they constitute Rules of the House and potentially affect the legislative process. Detailed procedures for the consideration in the Senate of a joint resolution disapproving an agency rule may be found in the statute (5 U.S.C. 802).</p>
