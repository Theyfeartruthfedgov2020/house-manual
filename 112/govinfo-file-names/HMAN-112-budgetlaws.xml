          <note>
            <p>The Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 (tit. XIII, P.L. 101–508) modified paragraphs (2) and (6) of this section and added paragraphs (7) and (8). Two separate sections of the 1990 Act amended paragraph (2): section 13201 added a new sentence at the end of the paragraph; section 13211 rewrote the paragraph entirely, effective for fiscal years after 1991. The text depicted here attempts to harmonize the two; but see 2 U.S.C. 622(2). The Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (tit. II of P.L. 99–177) added paragraphs (9) and (10). The Budget Enforcement Act of 1997 (sec. 10101 of P.L. 105–33) amended the definition of “entitlement authority” in paragraph (9) in conjunction with amendments to section 401. The Budget Control Act of 2011 (sec. 105 of P.L. 112–25) added paragraph (11).</p>
            <p>Amounts of liquidating cash provided in the annual bill making appropriations for the Department of Transportation are not new budget authority within the meaning of this section, but are merely funds to liquidate contractual obligations previously incurred pursuant to new discretionary contract authority previously reported from and scored against allocations to the Committee on Public Works and Transportation (now Transportation and Infrastructure) as the authority to enter into obligations that will result in immediate or future outlays (July 30, 1986, p. 18154).</p>

              <note>
                <p>The Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 (tit. XIII, P.L. 101–508) added paragraphs (6) and (7) and a new last sentence to subsection (a), added paragraphs (5)–(8) to subsection (b), and added former section 606 (repealed by the Budget Enforcement Act of 1997 (sec. 10118, P.L. 105–33)), requiring that a concurrent resolution on the budget set forth appropriate levels for five fiscal years for the matters described in subsection (a). Title III had previously been comprehensively amended by the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (tit. II, P.L. 99–177). Sections 301(a) and 301(b) were amended by the Budget Enforcement Act of 1997 (sec. 10105, P.L. 105–33) to extend the requirement that the term of budget resolutions be at least five years and to eliminate the requirement that budget resolutions contain direct loan and loan guarantee levels. In the 113th and 114th Congresses, the House prohibited consideration of a budget resolution not containing specified information on certain direct spending programs (sec. 3(e), H. Res. 5, Jan. 3, 2013, p. __; sec. 3(h), H. Res. 5, Jan. 6, 2015, p. __).</p>
                <p>The prescribed content of a concurrent resolution on the budget under the prior version of section 301 evolved over time. Pursuant to the authority to include other “appropriate procedures” under then section 301(b)(2) of the Budget Act, the first concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 1981 (which also contained the third concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 1980, budget targets for fiscal years 1981 and 1983, and other related matters) contained new provisions directing House and Senate committees to report to their respective Committees on the Budget reconciliation legislation reducing spending for fiscal year 1981 (H. Con. Res. 307, 96th Cong.). The first concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 1982, in addition to other new “appropriate procedures,” included in its reconciliation instructions directions to several House and Senate committees to report reductions in both entitlement spending authority and discretionary authorization programs sufficient to reduce budget authority and outlays separately for each of three fiscal years, and included a “deferred enrollment” procedure relating to bills containing new budget authority and entitlement spending authority in excess of allocations to committees (H. Con. Res. 115, 97th Cong.). The first concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 1983, in addition to other new “appropriate procedures,” included a binding Federal credit budget for two fiscal years, containing not only aggregate and functional category targets for new direct loan obligations and new primary and secondary loan guarantee commitments, but also (1) prohibiting consideration of bills authorizing new loan obligations or new loan guarantee commitments not subject to the appropriations process with certain exceptions (now section 402(a)), and (2) establishing a ceiling on total new direct loan obligations and new primary or secondary loan guarantee commitments for the ensuing fiscal year upon adoption of the second concurrent resolution on the budget for that year (similar to the section 311 ceiling for direct budget authority). Also included was a prohibition against consideration in either House of measures providing new budget or entitlement authority until the reporting committee filed a report in the House concerning its section 302(b) allocation (now section 302(c)) and a direction that if a second concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 1983 was not finally adopted by October 1, then the aggregate amounts in that first concurrent resolution would become the spending ceilings and revenue floor for the purposes of section 311 (S. Con. Res. 92, 97th Cong.). The first concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 1984 likewise contained the latter provision, but also provided that a point of order under section 311 of the Budget Act would not apply if spending contained in a bill remained within the reporting committee’s discretionary allocation under section 302 (section 311(b) contains a similar exception). The 1984 resolution also contained a new provision reserving specific amounts of budget authority and outlays for subsequent allocation to committees by the Committee on the Budget (H. Con. Res. 91, 98th Cong.; see also Mar. 6, 1984, p. 4621, for a statement by Speaker O’Neill describing the operation and effect of the latter provision). The first concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 1985 included a similar provision that it be treated as the second budget resolution for that year on October 1, 1984, for the purposes of the section 311 spending ceilings and revenue levels, but that a point of order not apply where the committee in question had not exceeded its section 302(a) allocations. The resolution also provided that legislation providing budget authority, entitlement authority, or credit authority not be considered until the reporting committee filed the requisite report concerning its section 302(b) allocations (H. Con. Res. 280, 98th Cong.).</p>
                <p>In 1986, the first concurrent resolution on the budget since the enactment of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (P.L. 99–177), the recommended deficit level for fiscal year 1987 was below the maximum deficit amount as then specified, thus permitting consideration of the conference reported amendment in disagreement pursuant to then section 301(i) without a waiver by three-fifths vote in either House (June 26, 1986, p. 15740). That concurrent resolution also contained a “contingency fund” for deficit reduction and unmet critical needs, additional general revenue-sharing funding beyond levels contained therein if deficits were not increased and authorization enacted, and a provision authorizing a report to be filed by the chair of the House Committee on the Budget by a date certain to be printed and to constitute allocations of new budget authority and outlays required by section 302(a) (where the conferees did not have time to prepare allocations prior to filing of the conference report).</p>
                <p>The concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal years 1988–1990 contained a provision permitting the first concurrent resolution to “become” a second binding concurrent resolution only at the beginning of the fiscal year. It also contained a provision encouraging sales of Government assets to non-Government buyers but providing that amounts realized not be treated as revenues, receipts, or negative outlays for purposes of specified budget enforcement and scorekeeping procedures (H. Con. Res. 93, 100th Cong.). The concurrent resolutions on the budget for fiscal years 1989–1991 and for fiscal years 1990–1992, respectively, each contained a section stating that, for purposes of allocations and points of order under section 302, amounts realized from asset sales and prepayments of loans would not be allocated or scored as affecting budget authority or outlays (H. Con. Res. 268, 100th Cong.; H. Con. Res. 106, 101st Cong.). The concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal years 1989–1991 also contained a section providing for a subsequent allocation of budget authority and outlays for fiscal year 1989 upon the reporting by appropriate committees of an anti-drug initiative (H. Con. Res. 268, 101st Cong.). The concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal years 1995–1999 included provisions (1) adjusting allocations of budget authority, new entitlement authority, and outlays and adjusting total levels of budget authority, outlays, and revenues for health care reform in the House (within a maximum aggregate deficit for fiscal years 1995–1999), and (2) adjusting committee allocations, budget aggregates, and the maximum deficit amount contingent on certain IRS compliance initiatives (H. Con. Res. 218, 103d Cong.). The concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal years 1996–2002 established a budget surplus allowance contemplating tax reductions only as part of a legislative package producing a balanced budget by fiscal year 2002; corrected a disparity that had arisen under the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 for the scoring of student loans; and established a process for certifying a balanced budget before the House could consider a reconciliation bill reducing taxes (H. Con. Res. 67, 104th Cong.).</p>
                <p>Concurrent resolutions on the budget have included reconciliation instructions that contemplated reductions in revenues (<i>e.g.</i>, H. Con. Res. 95, 109th Cong.), including one that contemplated two bills reducing revenues (H. Con. Res. 178, 104th Cong.).</p>
                <p>The concurrent resolutions on the budget for fiscal years 2000 and 2001 included a point of order against consideration in the House or Senate of a concurrent resolution on the budget for the next fiscal year, or any amendment thereto or conference report thereon, that sets forth a deficit for any fiscal year (as determined by the Committee on the Budget) (sec. 201, H. Con. Res. 68, 106th Cong.; sec. 201, H. Con. Res. 290, 106th Cong.).</p>
                <p>The concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2001 also included points of order against consideration in the House of a reported bill or joint resolution, or any amendment thereto or conference report thereon: (1) that would cause a surplus for fiscal year 2001 to be less than the level established in the resolution; and (2) that, until January 1, 2001, contained a directed scorekeeping provision (secs. 202, 203, H. Con. Res. 290, 106th Cong.).</p>
                <p>Budget resolutions have established a point of order against a measure that would cause the total level of discretionary advance appropriations to exceed a set amount (secs. 202, 203, H. Con. Res. 290, 106th Cong.; sec. 201, H. Con. Res. 83, 107th Cong.; sec. 301, H. Con. Res. 353, 107th Cong., deemed in place by H. Res. 428, 107th Cong., May 22, 2002, pp. 8675, 8676, and by sec. 3(a)(4), H. Res. 5, 108th Cong., Jan. 7, 2003, p. 10; sec. 501, H. Con. Res. 95, 108th Cong.; sec. 401, S. Con.

Res. 95, 109th Cong.; sec. 206, S. Con. Res. 21, 110th Cong.; sec. 302, S. Con. Res. 70, 110th Cong.; sec. 424, S. Con. Res. 13, 111th Cong. (carried forward by H. Res. 1493, 111th Cong.); sec. 402. H. Con. Res. 34, 112th Cong., deemed in place by H. Res. 287, 112th Cong., June 1, 2011; sec. 501, H. Con. Res. 112, 112th Cong., deemed in place by H.

Such point of order has also been established for a Congress in the absence of a budget resolution (sec. 3(e), H. Res. 5, Jan. 5, 2011, p. 80).</p>
                <p>Budget resolutions have provided that new budget authority, new entitlement authority, outlays, and receipts designated as an emergency in bills, joint resolutions, amendments, or conference reports are not cognizable under specified sections of titles III and IV of the Budget Act. The budget resolutions also have required to be included in a committee report, joint statement of managers, or the Congressional Record an explanation of how an emergency item meets certain criteria (sec. 502, H. Con. Res. 95, 108th Cong.; sec. 402, S. Con. Res. 95, 108th Cong., May 19, 2004, deemed in place by H. Res. 649, 108th Cong., May 19, 2004, p. 10105, and by sec. 3(a)(4), H. Res. 5, 109th Cong., Jan. 4, 2005, p. 44; sec. 402, H. Con. Res. 95, 109th Cong.; sec. 204, S. Con. Res. 21, 110th Cong.; sec. 301, S. Con. Res. 70, 110th Cong.). The concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2005 also provided that new budget authority, new entitlement authority, and outlays contained in a supplemental appropriation bill for fiscal year 2005 for overseas contingency operations related to the war or terrorism were not cognizable under sections 302, 303 and 401 of the Budget Act (sec. 403, S. Con. Res. 95, 108th Cong., May 19, 2004, deemed in place by H. Res. 649, 108th Cong., May 19, 2004, p. 10105, and by sec. 3(a)(4), H. Res. 5, 109th Cong., Jan. 4, 2005, p. 44). Budget resolutions have also provided that new budget authority, outlays, or receipts resulting from appropriations for overseas deployments and related activities are not cognizable under titles III and IV of the Budget Act (sec. 207, S. Con. Res. 21, 110th Cong.; sec. 301, S. Con. Res. 70, 110th Cong.).</p>
                <p>The concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2006 included a provision permitting the chair of the Committee on the Budget to make adjustments to levels and allocations to conform to changes in concepts or definitions and a provision providing for a section 302(b) suballocation to the full Appropriations Committee for appropriations for the Legislative Branch (secs. 406, 410, H. Con. Res. 95, 109th Cong.).</p>
                <p>The House has adopted resolutions to deem budget resolutions, portions thereof, or other budgetary parameters to be in place for temporary enforcement (H. Res. 231, July 24, 1985, p. 20181; H. Res. 413, June 19, 1990, p. 14612; H. Res. 477, June 19, 1998, p. 12991; ; H. Res. 428, May 22, 2002, pp. 8675, 8676; sec. 3(a)(4), H. Res. 5, Jan. 7, 2003, p. 10; H. Res. 649, May 19, 2004, p. 10105; sec. 3(a)(4), H. Res. 5, Jan. 4, 2005, p. 44; sec. 2(a), H. Res. 818, May 18, 2006, p. 8651; sec. 511(a)(4), H. Res. 6, Jan. 4, 2007, p. 19 (adopted Jan. 5, 2007); H. Res. 1493, July 1, 2010, p. 12572; H. Res. 287, June 1, 2011, pp. 8438, 8439; H. Res. 614, Apr. 17, 2012, p. __ (amended by H. Res. 643, May 8, 2012, p. __); sec. 3(c), H. Res. 5, Jan. 3, 2013, p. __; H. Res. 243, June 4, 2013, p. __; H. Res. 557, Apr. 30, 2014, p. __; sec. 3(e)(1), H. Res. 5, Jan. 6, 2015, p. __; H. Res. 223, Apr. 29, 2015, p. __). The House has also directed the chair of the Committee on the Budget to publish in the Congressional Record budget aggregates and allocations and provided that such figures be treated as completion of a budget resolution (sec. 2(a), H. Res. 5, Jan. 6, 1999, p. 47; sec. 3(b), H. Res. 5, Jan. 5, 2011, p. 80) and in one case further specified the level of an allocation to be so published by reference to a given fiscal year (H. Res. 38, Jan. 25, 2011, p. 627). For fiscal year 2014, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 (div. A, P.L. 113–67) provided by statute for such a publication and required that certain levels be set by reference to statutory discretionary spending caps or to a published baseline (sec. 111), and in the next Congress the levels in that publication (as subsequently adjusted) were deemed to be in force for the first session (sec. 3(e)(1), H. Res. 5, Jan. 6, 2015, p. __). That act had a similar provision for fiscal year 2015 (sec. 115), but contingent on Congress not adopting a budget resolution for that fiscal year.</p>

              <note>
                <p>The Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (tit. II, P.L. 99–177) modified this portion of section 301 by: (1) inserting a new subsection on referral of budget resolutions to the Committee on Rules; (2) amending and redesignating existing subsections (c), (d), and (e) as (d), (e), and (f), respectively; and (3) adding new subsections (g) (which was amended by Public Law 100–119) and (h). It also added a former subsection (i), which precluded consideration of a concurrent resolution on the budget exceeding the pertinent maximum deficit amount absent a three-fifths vote. That point of order was amended by Public Law 100–119 and was eliminated by the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 (tit. XIII, P.L. 101–508). The Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 (P.L. 100–418) added paragraph (10) to subsection (e), effective only for fiscal years 1989 through 1992. Previously, the Full Employment and Balanced Growth Act of 1978 (P.L. 95–523) amended this section by: (1) adding a new paragraph (6) to subsection (a) and redesignating the succeeding paragraph (both of which were later repealed by P.L. 99–177); (2) adding a new second sentence to subsection (c) (now contained in subsection (d)); and (3) adding a new subsection (e) (now designated as (f)), relating to the review of the Economic Report as part of the congressional budget process, and allowing the inclusion in the budget resolution of a timetable for achieving unemployment goals under the Employment Act of 1946. The last sentence of subsection (d) was added by the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (sec. 102(2), P.L. 104–4; 109 Stat. 62). The Social Security point of order contained in paragraph (i) was added by the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 (tit. XIII, P.L. 101–508) and later expanded by the Budget Enforcement Act of 1997 (sec. 10105, P.L. 105–33).</p>
                <p>The House and Senate completed final action on the first concurrent resolution on the budget considered under the Congressional Budget Act by adopting a conference report thereon on May 14, 1975 (p. 14329). That concurrent resolution contained aggregate figures only for revenues, budget authority, budget outlays, deficit and public debt, because the Committee on the Budget had not implemented the functional categories provisions of the Act for fiscal year 1976.</p>
                <p>On May 13, 1976, the House and Senate completed final action on the first concurrent resolution for fiscal year 1977, the first year of full implementation of title III of the Congressional Budget Act (p. 13776).</p>

              <p>Section 302 was amended by the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (tit. II, P.L. 99–177) to: (1) add appropriate levels of total entitlement authority and total credit authority to the allocations required by subsection (a), with all levels further divided into mandatory and discretionary amounts; (2) add new credit authority to the subdivisions required of the Committees on Appropriations by subsection (b)(1); (3) redesignate subsection (c) as (d); and (4) add new subsections (c), (e), (f), and (g). The Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 (tit. XIII, P.L. 101–508) removed credit authority from the purview of points of order under this section by deleting all references to credit authority in subsections (a), (b), (c), and (f), effective for fiscal years beginning after September 30, 1991. That law also amended subsections (c) and (f) to standardize their application to bills, joint resolutions, amendments, motions, or conference reports. Section 302 was further amended by the Budget Enforcement Act of 1997 (sec. 10106, P.L. 105–33) to: (1) permanently extend the requirement that allocations to the authorizing committees cover at least a five-year period and to revert the temporary allocations under former section 602 into section 302; (2) permit a further allocation among defense, nondefense, and violent crime reduction funding; (3) modify the  Committee on Appropriations’ default allocation; and (4) clarify that committee’s suballocations to its subcommittees.</p>
              <p>Clause 8 of rule XXI, adopted in the 110th Congress, provides that points of order under title III of the Budget Act apply to unreported measures (sec. 403, H. Res. 6, Jan. 4, 2007, p. 19 (adopted Jan. 5, 2007)). Previously, a point of order under section 302(f) operated with respect to a bill or joint resolution in its reported state and thus did not lie against consideration of an unreported measure (Mar. 21, 1995, p. 8491). The budget resolution deemed in place for fiscal year 2005 provided that, for purposes of titles II and III of the Budget Act, the term “amendment” or “amendment thereto” means an amendment offered or an amendment made in order as original text or considered as adopted by special order of the House (sec. 406, S. Con. Res. 95, 108th Cong., May 19, 2004, deemed in place by H. Res. 649, 108th Cong., May 19, 2004, p. 10105, and by sec. 3(a)(4), H. Res. 5, 109th Cong., Jan. 4, 2005, p. 44).</p>
              <p>Points of order under section 302(c) apply separately to the consideration of bills and amendments, and thus a waiver of points of order against consideration of an appropriation bill before the filing of a report from the Appropriations Committee allocating new budget authority among its subcommittees does not extend to an amendment providing new budget authority in addition to the amounts contained in the bill (July 13, 1987, p. 19514). Where the House deemed the adoption of new section 302(a) allocations for the 108th Congress (sec. 3, H. Res. 5, Jan. 7, 2003, p. 10), the Chair sustained a point of order under section 302(c) against an amendment providing new budget authority where the Appropriations Committee had not reported section 302(b) suballocations (Jan. 8, 2003, p. 225; Jan. 28, 2003, p. 2009 (both sustained by tabling of appeal)).</p>
              <p>By way of example, the Chair has held the following as providing new budget authority in excess of the relevant allocations under section 302(a), as authoritatively estimated by the Committee on the Budget pursuant to section 312(a), in violation of section 302(f): (1) a motion to recommit a bill establishing a Medicare prescription drug benefit program with instructions to report forthwith an amendment in the nature of substitute containing a different program (sustained by tabling of appeal) (June 28, 2000, pp. 12736, 12751); (2) an amendment extending eligibility for Foster Care Maintenance Payments to a new class (Sept. 14, 2005, pp. 20218–20); (3) an amendment delaying the imposition of a monetary penalty resulting in a loss of offsetting receipts (July 18, 1991, p. 18860); (4) where a subcommittee of the Committee on Appropriations had received two separate allocations of budget authority, an amendment transferring funds from accounts under one allocation to accounts under the other, thereby exceeding the level of the latter allocation (July 18, 2012, p. __).</p>
              <p>An amendment that proposes offsetting increases and decreases in new budget authority is not subject to a point of order under section 302(f) (May 9, 1995, p. 12175). Amendments to an appropriation bill making a series of figure changes intended to offset one another and considered en bloc are subject to points of order under section 302(f) where the intended reductions in new discretionary budget authority fail to offset increases in such authority, so that the net effect of the amendments is to cause the bill to exceed the appropriate allocation of new discretionary budget authority made pursuant to section 302(b) for the fiscal year (July 30, 1986, p. 18154).</p>
              <p>Where a Senate amendment proposed to increase certain loan guarantees that were estimated by the Committee on the Budget to breach the subcommittee subdivision of new credit authority (as then required by this section), the Chair sustained a point of order under section 302(f) against a motion to concur therein (Oct. 20, 1990, p. 31517).</p>
              <p>Where a limitation on funds in a general appropriation bill was estimated under former section 302(g) (current section 312(a)) to provide negative new budget authority in an amount sufficient to avoid a breach of the pertinent allocation of such authority, an amendment striking the limitation from the bill was held to provide new budget authority causing such a breach, in violation of section 302(f) (June 26, 1991, p. 16474; June 13, 2000, p. 10501). An amendment proposing to strike from a general appropriation bill a proviso stating that a specified increment of new discretionary budget authority ostensibly provided by the bill would “become available for obligation only upon the enactment of future appropriations legislation” was held to cause the bill to provide additional new discretionary budget authority in that incremental amount, in breach of the pertinent allocation under sections 302 and 602, and therefore in violation of section 302(f) (June 26, 1996, p. 15563). An amendment proposing to strike from a general appropriation bill a rescission scored as negative budget authority was held to provide new budget authority in excess of the relevant allocation under section 302(b) (June 20, 2001, pp. 11248, 11249). The Chair relies on authoritative estimates from the Committee on the Budget pursuant to section 312(a) to determine whether an amendment to a general appropriation bill provides new budget authority in excess of the relevant allocation under section 302(b) in violation of section 302(f) (<i>e.g.</i>, June 8, 2000, pp. 9942, 9943; June 12, 2000, pp. 10377, 10378; Apr. 2, 2004, pp. 6355, 6374). Such estimates may be provided by the chair of the Committee on the Budget pursuant to clause 4 of rule XXIX.</p>
              <p>For a point of order against the motion to rise and report an appropriation bill to the House where the bill, as proposed to be amended, exceeds an applicable allocation of new budget authority under section 302(b) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, and procedures in the Committee of the Whole in the event that the point of order is sustained, see §1044b, <i>supra</i>.</p>
              <p>The 104th Congress authorized the chair of the Committee on the Budget to revise existing allocations under this section among committees of the House to reflect changes in jurisdiction under clause 1 of rule X and to publish the revised allocations in the Congressional Record, to the end that the revised allocations be effective in the House as though made pursuant to sections 302(a) and 602(a) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 (sec. 202(c), H. Res. 6, Jan. 4, 1995, p. 467). The House has adopted resolutions to deem budget resolutions, or portions thereof, to be in place for temporary enforcement (see annotations under section 301(b) of this Act). The budget resolution deemed adopted for fiscal year 2003 established a reserve fund in the House to support an extra allocation for propositions providing for specified increases in obligation levels for highway spending, with a special application of section 302(f) to enforce levels of outlays (as well as budget authority) in that area, and provided for a separate, exclusive section 302(a) allocation for medicare spending (on one-year and 10-year bases) (sec. 204, H. Con. Res. 353, 107th Cong., deemed in place by H. Res. 428, 107th Cong., May 22, 2002, pp. 8675, 8676, and by sec. 3, H. Res. 5, 108th Cong., Jan. 7, 2003, p. 10). The special allocation for surface transportation was carried in the budget resolution for fiscal year 2004 (sec. 501, H. Con. Res. 95, 108th Cong.) and in the budget resolution deemed in place for fiscal year 2005 (sec. 401, S. Con. Res. 95, 108th Cong., May 19, 2004, deemed in place by H. Res. 649, 108th Cong., May 19, 2004, p. 10105, and by sec. 3(a)(4), H. Res. 5, 109th Cong., Jan. 4, 2005, p. 44). Budget resolutions have established reserve funds in the House to support extra allocations for various propositions covering a broad range of subjects (<i>e.g.,</i> secs. 201–220, S. Con. Res. 70, 110th Cong.). The House has provided that, for purposes of subsection (f), certain off-budget discretionary amounts be included in estimates of budget authority and outlays (sec. 3(f)(2), H. Res. 5, Jan. 5, 2011, p. 80).</p>

            <note>
              <p>The Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (tit. II, P.L. 99–177) amended subsection 303(a) by: (1) adding the phrase “as reported to the House or Senate”; (2) modifying paragraph (4) to apply to new entitlement authority; and (3) adding a paragraph (5) relating to new credit authority. The same law amended subsection (b) by adding the May 15th exception for general appropriation bills. The Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 (tit. XIII, P.L. 101–508) amended subsection (a) to standardize its application to bills, joint resolutions, amendments, motions, and conference reports, and by deleting the reference in paragraph (5) to new credit authority. That law also subdivided subsection (b) into paragraphs relating to exceptions in the House and Senate. Section 303 was rewritten by the Budget Enforcement Act of 1997 (sec. 10107, P.L. 105–33) to simplify the section, drop obsolete provisions, make certain conforming changes, and eliminate references to “new entitlement authority” in the House and “new credit authority.”</p>
              <p>Clause 8 of rule XXI, adopted in the 110th Congress, provides that points of order under title III of the Budget Act apply to unreported measures (sec. 403, H. Res. 6, Jan. 4, 2007, p. 19 (adopted Jan. 5, 2007)). Previously, a point of order under section 303(a) operated with respect to a bill or joint resolution in its reported state and thus did not lie against consideration of an unreported measure (Mar. 21, 1995, p. 8491), although it did lie against consideration of an amendment to an unreported measure (July 24, 1998, p. 17278). The budget resolution deemed in place for fiscal year 2005 provided that, for purposes of titles II and III of the Budget Act, the term “amendment” or “amendment thereto” means an amendment offered or an amendment made in order as original text or considered as adopted by special order of the House (sec. 406, S. Con. Res. 95, 108th Cong., May 19, 2004, deemed in place by H. Res. 649, 108th Cong., May 19, 2004, p. 10105, and by sec. 3(a)(4), H. Res. 5, 109th Cong., Jan. 4, 2005, p. 44).</p>
              <p>A conference report containing revenue-sharing provisions in the form of new entitlement authority as described in section 401(c)(2)(C) of the Budget Act to become effective in fiscal years 1978 through 1980 in amounts greater than the amount in fiscal year 1977 was ruled out on a point of order under section 303(a), because the first concurrent resolution on the budget for those future fiscal years had not yet been adopted and the increased entitlements could not be considered mere continuations of entitlement authority that became effective in fiscal year 1977 (for which a concurrent resolution had been adopted), and because the section 303(b) exception permitting certain advance budget authority does not apply in the case of new entitlement authority (Speaker Albert, Sept. 30, 1976, p. 34074). An amendment providing new budget authority for a fiscal year before adoption of a budget resolution for that year was held to violate section 303, where points of order under that section had been waived against the pending bill but not against amendments (Aug. 1, 1984, p. 21871; July 17, 1985, pp. 19435, 19463 (amendment contained in motion to recommit with instructions)).</p>
              <p>To a bill providing eligibility for certain entitlement benefits to become effective in the fiscal year for which a budget resolution had been adopted, an amendment allowing a deduction in computing household income to determine eligibility effective in the next following fiscal year, to reflect changes in shelter and utility costs, was ruled out as providing new entitlement authority to become effective in a fiscal year for which a concurrent resolution on the budget had not been adopted, in violation of section 303(a)(4) (July 27, 1977, p. 25222).</p>
              <p>To a bill partially replacing an existing mandatory student loan (entitlement) program with a new discretionary program, an amendment reducing the discretionary program and commensurately restoring the mandatory program was held to violate section 303(a) by providing new entitlement authority for the ensuing fiscal year before the adoption of a concurrent resolution on the budget for that fiscal year (Mar. 26, 1992, p. 7173). Amendments enlarging the class of persons eligible for, or increasing the amount of, a Government subsidy (lower interest payments on student loans) have been held to violate section 303(a) by providing new entitlement authority for the ensuing fiscal year before the adoption of a concurrent resolution on the budget for that fiscal year (Mar. 26, 1992, pp. 7184, 7186, 7227, 7231, 7236).</p>
              <p>An amendment repealing an agricultural marketing (entitlement) program for peanuts over a five-year period was nevertheless held to provide new budget authority for the ensuing fiscal year before the adoption of the budget resolution for that year, in violation of section 303(a), where the Chair was persuaded by estimates from the Congressional Budget Office that economic conditions under that repeal would result in decreased receipts and increased Federal outlays during that first fiscal year (July 25, 1990, p. 19155).</p>
              <p>An amendment imposing fees on generated electric energy, to be deposited in a trust fund, and effective in the ensuing fiscal year, was held to violate section 303(a) by increasing revenues effective in the ensuing fiscal year, for which a budget resolution had yet to be adopted (July 23, 1985, p. 20041). An amendment striking a revenue provision in a pending unreported bill and proposing to insert an alternative revenue provision was held to violate section 303(a) (July 24, 1998, p. 17278).</p>
              <p>The Committee on the Budget of the House determined, as stated in its second report on the implementation of congressional budget procedures for fiscal year 1976 (H. Rept. No. 94–457, Oct. 8, 1975), that the section 303(b) exemption for certain advance budget or revenue authority ceases to apply with the beginning of the fiscal year in question. Therefore, on or after October 1, 1975, the beginning of fiscal year 1976, budget authority or revenue measures to become effective in fiscal year 1977, could no longer be considered under the 303(b) exception but would have to await the final adoption in May of the first concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 1977. But the Senate in the 95th Congress overruled a decision of its presiding officer holding that the section 303(b) exemption ceased to apply after the beginning of the fiscal year preceding the fiscal year for which revenue changes were proposed (Oct. 5, 1978, pp. 33945–50).</p>
              <p>In the 106th through 113th Congresses, the House adopted an order to enforce a 303(a) point of order against a reported bill or joint resolution considered under a special order of business on the basis of text made in order as original text (sec. 2(a)(3), H. Res. 5, Jan. 6, 1999, p. 47; sec. 3(b)(2), H. Res. 5, Jan. 3, 2001, p. 24; sec. 3(a)(2), H. Res. 5, Jan. 7, 2003, p. 10; sec. 3(a)(2), H. Res. 5, Jan. 4, 2005, p. 44; sec. 511(a)(2), H. Res. 6, Jan. 4, 2007, p. 19 (adopted Jan. 5, 2007); sec. 3(a)(2), H. Res. 5, Jan. 6, 2009, p. 9; sec. 3(a)(2), H. Res. 5, Jan. 5, 2011, p. 80; sec. 3(b)(2), H. Res. 5, Jan. 3, 2013, p. __).  These orders were no longer necessary after an amendment to section 315 by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 (div. A, P.L. 113–67).</p>
              <p>The House has adopted resolutions to deem budget resolutions, or portions thereof, to be in place for temporary enforcement (see annotations under section 301(b) of this Act).</p>

            <text>At any time after the concurrent resolution on the budget for a fiscal year has been agreed to pursuant to section 301, and before the end of such fiscal year, the two Houses may adopt a concurrent resolution on the budget which revises or reaffirms the concurrent resolution on the budget for such fiscal year most recently agreed to.</text>
            <note>
              <p>The Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 (tit. XIII, P.L. 101–508) deleted a subsection (b), relating to maximum deficit amount requirements for revised budget resolutions, that had been added by the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (tit. II, P.L. 99–177), and redesignated the subsection on economic assumptions, originally added by Public Law 100–119, as (b). The latter subsection (b) was deleted by the Budget Enforcement Act of 1997 (sec. 10108, P.L. 105–33). Although not a section 304 revision, the House has by simple resolution modified amounts in House enforcement provisions of a concurrent resolution on the budget (sec. 2, H.

              <note>
                <p>The Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (tit. II, P.L. 99–177) amended section 305 in several places, with the most important changes being the reduction in the availability requirement for the committee report on a budget resolution to five days (from 10) and the addition of a one-day availability requirement for any report thereon from the Committee on Rules. The Full Employment and Balanced Growth Act of 1978 (P.L. 95–523) amended this subsection by adding subparagraphs (3) and (4) and making conforming changes relating to debate and amendments on economic goals and policies during consideration of the first concurrent resolution on the budget in the House. A similar addition relating to Senate procedure was made in subparagraphs (3) and (4). The Budget Enforcement Act of 1997 (sec. 10109, P.L. 105–33) amended section 305(a)(1) to provide a three-day layover requirement for the concurrent resolution on the budget.</p>
                <p>General debate on economic goals and policies under subsection (a)(3) must be confined to that subject (Apr. 23, 1980, p. 8815). Clause 10 of rule XVIII (former clause 8 of rule XXVIII), as added in the 95th Congress (H. Res. 5, Jan. 4, 1977, pp. 53–70) requires that any concurrent resolution on the budget (consisting of both aggregate totals and functional categories) be considered as read and open to amendment at any point, and unanimous consent is required to read such a concurrent resolution by section in order to allow amendments to aggregates to be considered before amendments to functional categories (May 2, 1978, pp. 12074, 12075). Clause 10 of rule XVIII (former clause 8 of rule XXIII) was further amended in the 96th Congress (H. Res. 5, Jan. 15, 1979, pp. 7–16) to require that amendments to budget resolutions achieve mathematical consistency and contain all the matter set forth in subsections 301(a)(1) through (5). On one occasion, the chair of the Committee on the Budget offered a “mathematical consistency” amendment in Committee of the Whole, rather than in the House (Apr. 29, 1976, p. 11916).</p>
                <p>A concurrent resolution on the budget is subject to a demand for a division of the question if, for example, the resolution grammatically and substantively relates to different fiscal years (May 7, 1980, pp. 10185–87) or includes a separate, hortatory section having its own grammatical and substantive meaning (Mar. 5, 1992, p. 4675).</p>
                <p>Where a perfecting amendment changing several figures in a concurrent resolution on the budget was pending in Committee of the Whole, the Chair indicated that adoption of that amendment would preclude a further amendment merely changing those figures but would not preclude a more comprehensive amendment changing other (unamended) portions of the resolution (Apr. 28, 1976, p. 11599).</p>
                <p>Although under this paragraph there can be up to five hours of debate on a conference report on a concurrent resolution on the budget, where the conferees report in total disagreement, debate on the motion to dispose of the amendment in disagreement is under the “hour rule” and is equally divided and controlled between the majority and minority parties under clause 8(d) of rule XXII (former clause 2 of rule XXVIII) (May 13, 1976, p. 13756; Sept. 16, 1976, p. 30182).</p>
                <p>A concurrent resolution on the budget providing for the production of three separate reconciliation bills, including a reconciliation bill that lowers revenues, is privileged in the Senate under section 305(b) (May 21, 1996, pp. 11937–41).</p>
                <p>In the 96th Congress, for the first time, the Committee on Rules reported and the House adopted a special order permitting only certain designated amendments to be offered to a concurrent resolution on the budget (H. Res. 642, Apr. 23, 1980, p. 8789). The House has adopted similar “modified-closed rules” for the consideration of concurrent resolutions on the budget in each subsequent Congress. In the 98th Congress, a special order (H. Res. 144, Mar. 22, 1983, p. 6503) waiving the existing 10-day layover requirement of section 305(a)(1) was construed not to have waived the separate three-day layover requirement of clause 4 of rule XIII (former clause 2(l)(6) of rule XI, amended in the 102d Congress (H. Res. 5, Jan. 3, 1991, p. 39) to conform to the five-day layover requirement of this section). The House has adopted resolutions to deem budget resolutions, or portions thereof, to be in place for temporary enforcement (see annotations under section 301(b) of this Act).</p>

            <note>
              <p>The Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 (tit. XIII, P.L. 101–508) amended this section to standardize its application to any bill, resolution, amendment, motion, or conference report. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 (div. A, P.L. 113–67) separated the section into two subsections to provide that the point of order applies in the House to a joint resolution but not any other resolution. This change codified separate orders adopted by the House from the 107th through 113th Congresses that construed the term “resolution” in the former unified section as “joint resolution” (sec. 3(b), H. Res. 5, Jan. 3, 2001, p. 24; sec. 3(a)(1), H. Res. 5, Jan. 7, 2003, p. 10; sec. 3(a)(1), H. Res. 5, Jan. 4, 2005, p. 44; sec. 511(a)(1), H. Res. 6, Jan. 4, 2007, p. 19 (adopted Jan. 5, 2007); sec. 3(a)(1), H. Res. 5, Jan. 6, 2009, p. 9; sec. 3(a)(1), H. Res. 5, Jan. 5, 2011, p. 80; sec. 3(b)(1), H. Res. 5, Jan. 3, 2013, p. __). The 104th and 105th Congresses expanded the legislative jurisdiction of the Committee on the Budget (sec. 202(a), H. Res. 6, Jan. 4, 1995, p. 463; sec. 5, H. Res. 5, Jan. 7, 1997, p. 121). See clause 1(e) of rule X, <i>supra</i>. Pursuant to section 4(a)(4) of the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010 (tit. I, P.L. 111–139), a designation regarding budgetary effects under that Act is not considered a matter within the jurisdiction of the Committee on the Budget for purposes of section 306 enforcement.</p>
              <p>A special order of business adopted by the House providing for consideration of an unreported concurrent resolution on the budget upon the Speaker’s declaration that the House be resolved into the Committee of the Whole has the effect of discharging the Committee on the Budget when so announced by the Speaker, and need not contain the term “discharge” or waive points of order under this section, because the concurrent resolution is effectively discharged consistent with, and not in violation of, this section (Mar. 13, 1986, p. 4638).</p>
              <p>The following were held to violate this section: (1) an amendment directing that certain lease-purchase agreements be scored on an annual basis for budget purposes (July 19, 1999, p. 16615); and (2) an amendment designating an appropriation as “emergency spending” within the meaning of the budget-enforcement laws (Sept. 8, 1999, p. 20930).</p>
              <p>In the Senate, the following were held to violate this section: (1) to an omnibus revenue bill reported from the Committee on Finance containing certain tax credits, an amendment expressing the sense of Congress that under the Congressional Budget Act process the continuation of tax credits would be offset by reductions in Federal spending (June 18, 1976, pp. 19089–97); and (2) to a bill making comprehensive amendments to the Social Security Act, an amendment removing social security trust funds from the “unified budget” and establishing separate aggregate and functional categories in all concurrent resolutions on the budget for social security trust funds (Mar. 22, 1983, p. 6590).</p>

            </subsection>
            <note>
              <p>The Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (tit. II, P.L. 99–177) expanded the scope of subsection (a) to apply not only to reports on legislation providing budget authority and tax expenditures but also to reports on legislation providing new spending authority, new credit authority, and changes in revenues. That law also added the requirement that the same information be available to Members before consideration of conference reports or amendments in disagreement on such legislation, as well as subsections (b) and (c). The Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 (tit. XIII, P.L. 101–508) made conforming changes to subsections (a) and (b) to reflect the advent of five-year budget resolutions. Certain technical and conforming changes were made to this section by the Budget Enforcement Act of 1997 (sec. 10110, P.L. 105–33). The Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010 (tit. I, P.L. 111–139) added subsections (a)(3) and (d).</p>
              <p>Section 308(a)(1) does not apply either to the consideration or to the adoption of a special order reported from the Committee on Rules “self-executing” the adoption in the House of an amendment providing new budget authority, because the amendment is not separately before the House during consideration of the special order (but only when the bill of which it becomes a part is before the House), and because it is the amendment itself, and not the special order resolution, that provides the new budget authority (Feb. 24, 1993, p. 3543). A committee cost estimate identifying certain spending authority as recurring annually and indefinitely was held necessarily to address the five-year period required by this section (Nov. 20, 1993, p. 31354).</p>

            <note>
              <p>Until the enactment of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (tit. II, P.L. 99–177) this section required Congress to complete action on a concurrent resolution on the budget, normally the second for that fiscal year, reaffirming or revising the most recently agreed to concurrent resolution on the budget. It also permitted the second budget resolution to implement the reconciliation process (instructions to committees to make changes in law necessary to achieve the changes in spending or revenues contemplated by the budget resolution). The Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (tit. II, P.L. 99–177) amended subsection (a) to eliminate the requirement for subsequent budget resolutions and specified the reconciliation process in greater detail by adding paragraph (1)(D) to subsection (a) along with new subsections (b) through (g). The Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 (tit. XIII, P.L. 101–508) amended subsection (c), relating to adjustments to allocations in the Senate, and deleted from subsection (f) a June 15 deadline for congressional action on reconciliation. The Budget Enforcement Act of 1997 (sec. 10111, P.L. 105–33) amended section 310(c)(1)(A) to clarify that committees, in meeting their reconciliation targets, may alternatively substitute revenue and spending changes by up to 20 percent of the sum of the absolute value of reconciled changes as long as the result does not increase the deficit relative to the reconciliation instructions. Clause 7 of rule XXI places restrictions on reconciliation directives relative to direct spending.</p>

            <note>
              <p>The Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 (tit. XIII, P.L. 101–508) amended subsection (a) by: (1) standardizing its application to any bill, joint resolution, amendment, motion, or conference report; (2) adding the exception for the case of a declaration of war; and (3) adding a new paragraph (2) relating to Senate procedure. The Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (tit. II, P.L. 99–177) made important changes in this section by codifying in subsection (b) the exception for the House that previously had appeared in the budget resolution, and by adding subsection (c). The Budget Enforcement Act of 1997 (sec. 10112, P.L. 105–33) further amended this section by: (1) eliminating references to “new entitlement authority”; (2) modifying Senate procedure; and (3) enforcing the revenue level for the same multiyear period covered by the allocations under section 302(a).</p>
              <p>Clause 8 of rule XXI, adopted in the 110th Congress, provides that points of order under title III of the Budget Act apply to unreported measures (sec. 403, H. Res. 6, Jan. 4, 2007, p. 19 (adopted Jan. 5, 2007)). Previously, a point of order under section 311(a) operated with respect to a bill or joint resolution in its reported state and thus did not lie against consideration of an unreported measure (Mar. 21, 1995, p. 8491). The budget resolution deemed in place for fiscal year 2005 provided that, for purposes of titles II and III of the Budget Act, the term “amendment” or “amendment thereto” means an amendment offered or an amendment made in order as original text or considered as adopted by special order of the House (sec. 406, S. Con. Res. 95, 108th Cong., May 19, 2004, deemed in place by H. Res. 649, 108th Cong., May 19, 2004, p. 10105, and by sec. 3(a)(4), H. Res. 5, 109th Cong., Jan. 4, 2005, p. 44). The House has adopted resolutions to deem budget resolutions, or portions thereof, to be in place for temporary enforcement (see annotations under section 301(b) of this Act). A point of order under this section is untimely after consideration of the measure has begun (July 11, 2014, p. __).</p>
              <p>To an appropriation bill already containing new budget outlays in excess of the total level permitted by the second concurrent resolution on the budget for that fiscal year, where the bill was considered under a waiver of section 311(a) of the Budget Act, an amendment striking a proposed rescission of existing budget authority that had the effect of causing the net total of new budget authority in the bill to be increased was ruled out in the House as in violation of section 311(a), as further exceeding the total budget outlay ceiling in the second concurrent resolution on the budget (May 12, 1981, pp. 9314, 15). An amendment that provides no new budget authority or outlays but instead results in outlay savings is not subject to a point of order under section 311(a) (June 30, 1987, p. 18308).</p>
              <p>The Chair relied on estimates furnished by the Committee on the Budget to hold that a motion to amend a Senate amendment providing new budget authority for official mail costs to be available immediately violated section 311(a) because the appropriate level of new budget authority contained in the budget resolution had already been exceeded and because the Appropriations Committee had exceeded its section 302(a) allocation (thereby rendering the section 311(b) exception inapplicable) (Sept. 28, 1989, p. 22267).</p>
              <p>In the Senate, the Chair sustained a point of order (later withdrawn) against an amendment that had the effect of reducing revenues for fiscal year 1977 below the total level of revenues contained in the final concurrent resolution on the budget for that year, in violation of section 311(a) (Oct. 1, 1976, p. 34557). Similarly, a motion in the Senate to recommit a bill with instructions to report it back with an amendment to the Internal Revenue Code delaying the implementation of withholding on interest and dividends was held (in response to a parliamentary inquiry) to be subject to a point of order because the amendment would cause revenues to be less than the appropriate level provided in the budget resolution for that year (where S. Con. Res. 92 of the 97th Congress, the first budget resolution for fiscal year 1985, provided that if a second budget resolution was not adopted by October 1, 1982, then section 311 would be enforced based on the aggregate figures contained in that resolution) (Apr. 20, 1983, pp. 9131, 9151). A point of order was sustained (and upheld on appeal) in the Senate against consideration of an amendment reducing the amount of a rescission of appropriated funds where the effect was to increase the net amount of total budget outlays contained in the bill to a level that, when taken together with other spending actions already completed by Congress, exceeded the total amount of budget outlays provided for the current fiscal year in the third budget resolution, in violation of section 311 (June 27, 1980, pp. 17478, 17479). Also in the Senate, to a bill making comprehensive changes in the Social Security Act being considered at a time when the revenue floor established by the second concurrent resolution on the budget for that fiscal year had already been breached, an amendment to the Internal Revenue Code to delay interest and dividend withholding during that fiscal year was held to constitute a further revenue reduction and to violate section 311 (Vice President Bush, Mar. 22, 1983, p. 6573). An amendment in the Senate to a Defense Department authorization bill, providing a new entitlement program of educational assistance to members and veterans of the armed forces, to become effective in a future fiscal year or at any earlier time if so determined by the President, was held to allow new entitlement spending for the current fiscal year and to breach the applicable budget total, in violation of section 311 (July 13, 1983, p. 19018).</p>

The concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2000 included a point of order against consideration in the House or Senate of a concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2001, or any amendment thereto or conference report thereon, that sets forth a deficit for any fiscal year (as determined by the Committee on the Budget) (sec. 201, H.

              <p>Section 313, popularly known as the “Byrd Rule,” was added by the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 (tit. XIII, P.L. 101–508). The Budget Enforcement Act of 1997 effected a technical correction to this section (sec. 10113, P.L. 105–33). Changes in outlays or revenues are not rendered incidental under this section simply by their insusceptibility to measurement (Aug. 6, 1993, p. 19764). A provision that achieved a net reduction in revenue beyond the 10-year directive of the concurrent resolution on the budget was stricken under this section (July 28, 1999, pp. 18172, 18178).  An amendment expressing the sense of the Senate presents nonbinding language with no budgetary effect and is, therefore, in violation of this section (Oct. 27, 1995, p. 30379).</p>

              <p>This section was added by the Budget Enforcement Act of 1997 (sec. 10114, P.L. 105–33). Subsection (b)(6) was added by the Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997 (sec. 201(b), P.L. 105–89). Subsection (a) was amended and subsections (d) and (e) (later redesignated as (f)) were added by the Budget Control Act of 2011 (sec. 105, P.L. 112–25). Subsection (d)(2) was amended by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 (div. A, P.L. 113–67) to strike a subparagraph (A) that was erroneously duplicative of subsection (d)(1). Subsection (e) was added by the Temporary Payroll Tax Cut Continuation Act of 2011 (sec. 511, P.L. 112–78). Budget resolutions have provided that new budget authority, new entitlement authority, outlays, and receipts designated as an emergency in bills, joint resolutions, amendments, or conference reports are not cognizable under specified sections of title III and IV of the Budget Act. The budget resolutions also have required to be included in a committee report, joint statement of managers, or the Congressional Record an explanation of how an emergency item meets certain criteria (sec. 502, H. Con. Res. 95, 108th Cong.; sec. 402, S. Con. Res. 95, 108th Cong., May 19, 2004, deemed in place by H. Res. 649, 108th Cong., May 19, 2004, p. 10105, and by sec. 3(a)(4), H. Res. 5, 109th Cong., Jan. 4, 2005, p. 44; sec. 402, H. Con. Res. 95, 109th Cong.; sec. 204, S. Con. Res. 21, 110th Cong.; sec. 301, S. Con. Res. 70, 110th Cong.). The budget resolution adopted by the House in 2006 provided a specific amount of emergency spending that, to be exceeded, would require a vote of the Committee on the Budget to raise the relevant 302 allocation (sec. 501, H. Con. Res. 376, 109th Cong., May 18, 2006). In the absence of a budget resolution, the House has enabled the designation of budget authority or revenue as an emergency (sec. 3(c), H. Res. 5, Jan. 5, 2011, p. 80).</p>

              <p>This section was added by the Budget Enforcement Act of 1997 (sec. 10115, P.L. 105–33). The second sentence was added by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 (div.

See clause 8 of rule XXI for similar treatment of unreported bills under title III.</p>
              <p>The Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 (tit.

XIV, P.L. 103–66). Title VI was repealed by the Budget Enforcement Act of 1997 (sec. 10118, P.L. 105–33). For the text of title VI, see the House Rules and Manual for the 104th Congress (H.

              <note>
                <p>The Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (tit. II, P.L. 99–177) amended subsection (a) by substituting the phrase “spending authority” for “contract or borrowing authority” and extended the point of order to conference reports, consistent with House precedent. The Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (tit. II, P.L. 99–177) left the subsection entitled “exceptions” intact except to clarify the application of section 401 to Government corporations created after December 12, 1985. The Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 (tit. XIII, P.L. 101–508) amended subsections (a) and (b)(1) to standardize their application to any bill, joint resolution, amendment, motion, or conference report. The Budget Enforcement Act of 1997 (sec. 10116, P.L. 105–33): (1) repealed section 402, collapsing the point of order under that section into section 401; (2) repealed the definition of “new spending authority,” while shifting the definition of new entitlement authority to section 3; and (3) converted the mandatory referral of measures providing new entitlement authority to the Appropriations Committee to discretionary referral of such measures. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 (div. A, P.L. 113–67) added subsection (c)(3), codifying separate orders adopted by the House in the 109th and 110th Congresses (sec. 3(a)(3), H. Res. 5, Jan. 4, 2005, p. 44; sec. 511(a)(3), H. Res. 6, Jan. 4, 2007, p. 19 (adopted Jan. 5, 2007)). The 107th, 108th, 111th, 112th, and 113th Congresses had adopted similar orders regarding entitlement authority, but they were not limited to section 401 (sec. 3(b)(3), H. Res. 5, Jan. 3, 2001, p. 24; sec. 3(a)(3), H. Res. 5, Jan. 7, 2003, p. 10; sec. 3(a)(3), H. Res. 5, Jan. 6, 2009, p. 9; sec. 3(a)(3), H. Res. 5, Jan. 5, 2011, p. 80; sec. 3(b)(3), H. Res. 5, Jan. 3, 2013, p. __). The 106th Congress adopted a temporary version of that order (sec. 2(a)(2), H. Res. 5, Jan. 6, 1999, p. 47), which expired upon the adoption of the budget resolution for fiscal year 2000. Before these orders, an amendment establishing a new executive position at compensation level II but subjecting its salary to the appropriation process was held not to provide new entitlement authority (Mar. 26, 1992, p. 7203).</p>
                <p>Language in a bill authorizing receipts from loans under certain legislation to be made available for designated purposes was held not to be “new spending authority” that would prohibit the consideration of the bill under section 401(a) of the Congressional Budget Act, where it was shown from the term “authorized” and from the committee report on the bill that the amounts of repaid loans must again be appropriated in appropriation acts before the funds could be expended (Speaker Albert, Sept. 10, 1975, p. 28270). A point of order under section 401(a) operates with respect to a bill or joint resolution in reported state and thus does not lie against consideration of an unreported measure (Mar. 21, 1995, p. 8491). Section 401(a) prohibits the consideration of a bill or amendment, including a conference report, containing new spending authority to incur indebtedness for the repayment of which the United States is primarily liable, the budget authority for which is not provided in advance by appropriation acts. Thus a conference report authorizing a Secretary to borrow funds by issuing Government notes as a public debt transaction to make payments in connection with defaults on loans by medical students, not subject to amounts specified in advance by appropriation acts, was ruled out of order as violating section 401(a) (Sept. 27, 1976, pp. 32655–704).</p>
                <p>A point of order under section 401(b) operates with respect to a bill or joint resolution in reported state and thus does not lie against consideration of an unreported measure (Mar. 21, 1995, p. 8491).</p>
                <p>A conference report (filed in 1976 to accompany a bill originally reported in the House in calendar year 1975) requiring the Secretary of Agriculture to pay a cost of transporting agricultural commodities to major disaster areas upon the date of enactment was held to constitute new spending “entitlement” authority that could become effective before the fiscal year beginning during the calendar year in which the bill had been reported from conference, in violation of section 401(b)(1), and the conference report was ruled out of order (Speaker Albert, Sept. 23, 1976, pp. 32099, 32100). A Senate amendment providing new spending “entitlement” authority for adjustment assistance under the Trade Act of 1974, by requiring the Secretary of Labor to certify a new group of workers as eligible beginning on the day before to the start of the ensuing fiscal year, was conceded to violate section 401(b)(1), and a motion to concur was ruled out on that point of order (June 26, 1986, p. 15729). Where an amendment contained new entitlement authority in the form of retirement benefits to certain Federal employees, the Chair contemplated immediate enactment in his determination that the new entitlement authority became effective before the fiscal year beginning during the calendar year in which the pending bill was reported (May 9, 1995, p. 12178).</p>
                <p>Where a committee had not yet filed with the House a report subdividing among its subcommittees or by programs new entitlement authority allocated to that committee in the joint statement accompanying a conference report on a concurrent resolution on the budget, formerly required under section 302(a), the Speaker under section 401(b) referred to the Appropriations Committee for the 15-day period a bill reported by that committee that exceeded the total entitlement authority allocated to that committee in the joint statement, and also referred a subsequent bill reported by that committee that contained new entitlement authority (Speaker Albert, May 17, 1976, p. 14093; Aug. 25, 1976, p. 27775). During the efficacy of title VI, section 401(b)(2) had no practical effect because that section remained linked to section 302 rather than the overriding section 602. Before consideration of a bill in Committee of the Whole, the Speaker may discharge from the Union Calendar and refer to the Appropriations Committee for 15 days, pursuant to section 401(b), a bill that has been reported providing new entitlement authority in excess of the total amount allocated to the reporting committee (Speaker O’Neill, Sept. 8, 1977, p. 28153; Sept. 8, 1978, p. 28543) even if the bill was reported before final adoption of the first budget resolution (Speaker O’Neill, July 19, 1978, pp. 21786, 21787; May 21, 1981, p. 10622). A bill reported from the Committee on Agriculture amending the Food and Agriculture Act to increase certain commodity target prices of 1979 crops, thereby providing new entitlement authority for fiscal year 1980 in excess of the amount allocated to that committee under the first budget resolution, and a bill reported from the Committee on Ways and Means increasing eligibility and payments for child welfare and social services under the Social Security Act, providing new entitlement authority in excess of the net amount of such authority allocated to that committee under the first budget resolution, were discharged from the Union Calendar by the Speaker and referred to the Appropriations Committee pursuant to section 401(b) (Speaker O’Neill, June 5, 1979, p. 13385; June 6, 1979, p. 13665). The Speaker may exercise the referral authority under section 401(b), whether or not the committee has filed its report under section 302(b) of the Budget Act, where the budget authority for the entitlement bill has been assumed in the budget resolution and would be included in the committee’s 302(b) report, but where the budget authority for such bill exceeds the net amount of such authority allocated to the reporting committee, because the budget resolution assumes the reporting of other legislation, decreasing other programs for the year in question, that has yet to be reported (Speaker O’Neill, June 6, 1979, p. 13665).</p>
                <p>Although the former definition of new spending authority in section 401(c)(2) did not include the authority to insure or guarantee the repayment of indebtedness incurred by another person or government (as where the authority to incur contractual obligations to insure or guarantee another person’s debt is a contingent liability of the United States), the authority to make payments in connection with defaults that have already occurred was conceded to constitute a primary liability of the United States to incur indebtedness and to require budget authority in advance in appropriation acts (Sept. 27, 1976, pp. 32655–704). A provision that requires payments to individuals meeting certain qualifications, but that also contains an authorization for appropriations to make such payments and a provision that if sums appropriated pursuant thereto are insufficient to make payments, then payments be ratably reduced to the amounts of appropriations actually made, does not constitute new entitlement authority (Sept. 13, 1983, p. 23884).</p>
                <p>The former definition of new entitlement authority did not include revenue-sharing spending authority in the form of entitlements, because the exception from the definition of new spending authority for revenue-sharing programs did not apply to new entitlement authority for future fiscal years (Speaker Albert, Sept. 30, 1976, pp. 34074–100).</p>

                <p>The Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (tit. II, P.L. 99–177) amended this section by adding paragraph (4) to subsection (a), along with a conforming change to the second sentence of that subsection. Public Law 97–108 previously amended section 403 by adding subsections (a)(2), (b), and (c). The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 deleted from this section a requirement that the Director estimate costs incurred by State and local governments, in favor of a more particularized requirement in section 424, <i>infra</i> (sec. 104, P.L. 104–4; 109 Stat. 62). The Budget Enforcement Act of 1997 (sec. 10116, P.L. 105–33) redesignated this section, formerly section 403, as section 402. A committee cost estimate identifying certain spending authority as recurring annually and indefinitely was held necessarily to address the five-year period required by section 308 (Nov. 20, 1993, p. 31354). During the 102d Congress, former clause 8 of rule XXI required that certain measures contain a statement of cost by the Congressional Budget Office (H. Res. 5, Jan. 3, 1991, p. 39).</p>

            <note>
              <p>Part B of title IV was added by the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (sec. 101(a), P.L. 104–4; 109 Stat. 50–60). That Act explicitly declared that the new part was enacted as an exercise of congressional rulemaking powers (sec. 108; 109 Stat. 63–64).</p>
              <p>Pursuant to section 426, a Member raising a point of order under section 425 or 426 must specify the precise language upon which the point of order is based (see <i>e.g.,</i> May 23, 1996, p. 12283; May 14, 2008, p. 9050), and the content of estimates prepared under section 424 is a matter for debate (June 8, 2006, p 10457). A point of order under section 426 raised against consideration of a resolution providing a special order of business must specify the precise language upon which the point of order is based (see <i>e.g.,</i> June 10, 1998 p. 11853; June 26, 2001, p. 11906), which may include a waiver of points of order against amendments (Jan. 28, 2009, p. 1796; May 21, 2014, p. __), must be made when the special order is called up and comes too late after the resolution has been adopted (July 18, 1996, p. 17668), and may be raised against a resolution that, by hereby adopting legislative text, effectively waives the application of section 425 (Feb. 1, 2006, pp. 549, 550). A point of order under section 425 against consideration of a bill is properly raised pending the Speaker’s declaration that the House resolve into the Committee of the Whole for such consideration (Oct. 29, 1997, p. 23712). A statutorily privileged joint resolution of approval may be subject to a point of order under section 425 (May 8, 2002, p. 7145). Debate on the point of order is on the question of considering the underlying text that is the subject of the point of order (May 14, 2008, p. 9051). The Members controlling debate on the point of order may reserve their time (Mar. 28, 1996, p. 6932), and a manager of a measure who controls time for debate against the point of order that is to be resolved by a question of consideration has the right to close debate (June 10, 1998, p. 11854).</p>

            </subsection>
            <note>
              <p>Section 904 was amended by the Budget Enforcement Act of 1997 (sec. 10119, P.L. 105–33) to clarify points of order in the Senate that may be waived by a supermajority vote. The Senate extended to 2017 the expiration in subsection (e) in the budget resolution for fiscal year 2008 (sec. 205, S. Con. Res. 21, 110th Cong.).</p>
              <p>Pursuant to this section, and under its authority contained in clause 5 of rule XIII (former clause 4(b) of rule XI) to report on rules and the order of business, the Committee on Rules may report as privileged a resolution recommending the temporary waiver of the provisions of section 401 of the Congressional Budget Act during the consideration of designated legislation in the House (Speaker Albert, Mar. 20, 1975, p. 7676). A point of order against consideration of a resolution reported from the Committee on Rules providing for consideration of a concurrent resolution on the budget does not lie based upon alleged violation of a statute that merely reaffirms the congressional commitment towards achieving balanced Federal budgets (P.L. 96–389), because the statute does not constitute a rule of the House and because section 904 of the Budget Act acknowledges the constitutional authority of either House to change its rules at any time (June 10, 1982, pp. 13352, 13353). A unanimous-consent agreement that only permits a (nonprivileged) bill to be considered in the House before three-day availability of the report thereon, but that does not specifically waive points of order against consideration, does not preclude a point of order against consideration of the bill when called up based upon an alleged violation of the Budget Act (Feb. 4, 1982, p. 845).</p>
